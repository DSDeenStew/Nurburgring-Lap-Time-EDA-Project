# Nurburgring-Lap-Time-EDA-Project

  This Project takes a closer look at the record holding lap times around the Nürburgring Nordschleife racetrack. More specifically the vehicles and their performance on this renowned course.
Through analyzation we hope to discover how big of an impact vehicle power and weight are on its lap time performance.

  The Nürburgring Nordschleife racetrack is well known for testing the high performance racing capabilities of new vehicles. It's lap time is recognized as a benchmark worldwide amongst vehicle manufacturers and performance car enthusiasts.
  We obtain the data of 257 race road legal vehicles that are inscribed into the record table list from fastestlaps.com for this specific track. (fastestlaps.com/tracks/nordschleife)
  
  All the vehicles on the list are of "racing" standard but their performance differs greatly, with the lap time being the final verdict. The table also gives information on the driver of the record lap and the vehicles power and weight characteristics. With the Power to Weight ratio being a tell tail charcteristic of a performance vehicle, we will examine if there is any correlation between that and the speed of the lap times for these vehicles. We will also take a look at the vehicle driver and lastly the performance amongst manufacturers to see who produces the best road legal racecars according to these metrics.

  The analysis highlights the quickest vehicles around the track with The Mercedes AMG ONE holding the top position. We also see that Mercedes, Porsche and Mclaren are among the best in producing vehicles to this standard. We can also see that most of these vehicles have a weight between 3-4 thousand pounds and a Power rating under 750HP, with the outliers still having similar overal Power to Weight ratios. We can conclude that with all these vehicles having what is seen to be a Power to Weight ration in an optimal range, there is no direct correlation between a better ratio resulting in a better lap time amongst these vehicles. One would assume that the defining factors would be more related to the finer detail characteristics like those of aerodynamics and brake and tire capabilities amongst others.
